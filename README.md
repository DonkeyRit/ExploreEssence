## Project Description

MemoryMap is an innovative mobile application designed to revolutionize the way travelers capture, organize, and share their travel experiences. At its core, MemoryMap features a customizable interactive map that serves as a canvas for users to document their journeys in a visually appealing and informative manner.

### Key Features:

- **Customizable Interactive Map:** Users can personalize their maps with different styles and themes, tailoring the visual experience to their preferences or the nature of the location.
- **Geolocation-based Path Tracking:** The app tracks the user's path during their trip, allowing them to visualize their journey on the map.
- **Point-of-Interest (POI) Tagging:** Users can mark points of interest such as cafes, restaurants, and landmarks on the map, attaching photos or notes to these points.
- **Transaction Logging:** Travel expenses can be logged and linked to specific locations on the map, providing a financial overview of the trip.
- **Photo Integration:** Users can upload and link photos to locations on the map, with the option to integrate with social media platforms for easy sharing.
- **AI-powered Summary Generation (Future Feature):** An AI component will generate textual summaries or highlights of the trip based on the collected data.
- **Privacy Settings:** Users have control over the privacy of their maps and information, with options to keep them private or share them publicly.
- **Discovery Radar (Future Feature):** A feature that suggests nearby points of interest based on the user's current location.
